Midknight's BluCereal came true

# Getting started

## Installation
Clone this repo 😎, then go into the source code and run ``` npm i ```. Make sure already installed Ionic, Angular and also Cordova. To build the app, simply run ``` ionic cordova build ```.

## Usage
Before you even begin using the application, the device MUST already pair with the target device. Note that it is pair, not connected. In the app, in disconnected state, select the targeted device by hitting the connect button. You should be provied with a list of successfully paired device.

## Features
1. Cereal Bar (saved command to be executed instantly)
2. Joystick

Since I wrote this code in less than 3 hours, do not expect this is a full fledge solution with no bugs 🐛(I warned you)!
